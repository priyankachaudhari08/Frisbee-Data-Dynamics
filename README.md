# Frisbee-Data-Dynamics

Problem Statement:

Currently, Boston Glory does not sufficiently utilize the vast amount of data available to
make strategic decisions. The primary objective is to enhance the performance of the Boston
Glory frisbee team by leveraging data analytics to provide actionable insights. The focus is on
identifying key areas of offensive and defensive strengths and weaknesses and suggesting
on-field strategies that can lead to wins and championships within the UFA league.

Scope:

This project will encompass data collection and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis,
feature engineering, and machine learning model development. The data will be sourced from
the UFA API and processed through a Google Cloud infrastructure, including Google Big Query
for data storage and analysis. The goal is to analyze various performance metrics, such as points
per game, yards received, and defensive weaknesses, to provide comprehensive insights for
improving the team's strategies.
